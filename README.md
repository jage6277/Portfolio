# Portfolio
In this repository you will find some of the various projects I have worked on over the last few years. Here is a brief description of my projects:
- **PureCycle Exploratory Data Analysis:**
  In this project I use Python, Jupyter notebooks, and various open source libraries to do exploratory data analysis involving PureCycle Technologies. This is my most recent project and has several different examples of data visualizations and statistical analysis.
- **Schwarz Christoffel Transformations:**
  This is a complex analysis report about Schwarz Christoffel transformations.
- **Propagation of Voltage in a Neuron:**
  This project involves Fourier Series and has both theoretical and computational components. 
- **Discrete Structures:**
  In this section you will find a few code samples from my discrete structures class. Note that I am planning to add more to this section soon.  
 - **Drug Discovery Research Poster:**
  In this section you will find the poster a team and I presented at The Univervisty of Colorado Boulder's 2019 CURE Symposium. My team and I tested a potential cancer treatment, gathered and analyzed data, and presented our findings at a poster session.
