# Portfolio
In this repository you will find some of the various projects I have worked on over the years. Here is a brief description for each of my projects:
- **PureCycle Exploratory Data Analysis:**
  In this project I use Python, Jupyter notebooks, and various open source libraries to do exploratory data analysis around PureCycle's stock. Note that this is my most recent project.
- **Schwarz Christoffel Transformations:**
  This is a complex analysis project and is primarily theoretical. 
- **Propagation of Voltage in a Neuron:**
  This project involves Fourier Series and has both theoretical and computational components. 
- **Discrete Structures:**
  In this section you will find a few samples of code I wrote for my discrete structures class. Note that I am planning to add more to this section soon.
