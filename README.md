# Portfolio
In this repository you will find some of the various projects I have worked on over the last few years. Here is a brief description of my projects:
- **PureCycle Exploratory Data Analysis:**
  In this project I use Python, Jupyter notebooks, and various open source libraries to do exploratory data analysis involving PureCycle Technologies. This is my most recent project and has several different examples of data visualizations.
- **Schwarz Christoffel Transformations:**
  This project is a discussion of some theoretical components of complex analysis. 
- **Propagation of Voltage in a Neuron:**
  This project involves Fourier Series and has both theoretical and computational components. 
- **Discrete Structures:**
  In this section you will find a few samples of code I wrote for my discrete structures class. Note that I am planning to add more to this section soon.
